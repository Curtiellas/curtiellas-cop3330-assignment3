prompt for file name;
open file to scan;

while (current line is not null)
{
    append entire line to string;
}


while (the word still appears in the text)
{
    use string.indexOf to find index where the word appears first;

    reconstruct the text:
        [from 0 to index] + "use" + [from (index + 3) to end]
}

print the text to file;
