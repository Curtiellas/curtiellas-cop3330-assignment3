create an arrayList of maps

while ( the current line is not null )
{
    read entire line;

    separate each string in the line read;

    remove the comma from the first string (last name);

    add the strings saved as (firstName, "string") and (lastName, "string");

    add counter++ for each line, so that the number of people is recorded;
}

sort the arrayList using lastName;
