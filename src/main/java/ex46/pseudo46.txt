create arrayList of maps <String, String>
Ex.
"Word", whatever
"Count", 5

read all lines from file;

split whole string and use the first word, called 'replace';

    find index where 'replace' is;
    re-build whole text string without 'replace';
    repeat until 'replace' is no longer present in the text;
    each time a new occurrence of the word is found and replaced, add +1 to a counter;

    add the word 'replace' and the 'count' of that word to the arrayList;

repeat LINE 8 - LINE 15 until all the words in the text have been removed, recorded, and counted.
